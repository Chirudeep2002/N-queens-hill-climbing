# N-Queens Using Hill Climbing (Python)

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **N-Queens problem** solved using:

- Hill Climbing  
- Hill Climbing with Sideways Moves  
- Random-Restart Hill Climbing  

The program generates random board configurations, evaluates conflicts using a heuristic function, and applies local search techniques to find valid N-Queens solutions. It also performs multiple experimental runs and reports success rates and average steps.

## 📌 Features

- Random board generation
- Heuristic calculation (attacking queen pairs)
- Neighbor generation
- Standard hill climbing
- Hill climbing with sideways moves
- Random-restart hill climbing
- Experimental statistics:
  - Success rate
  - Failure rate
  - Average steps (success/failure)

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.8+

No external libraries required (uses only built-in modules).
